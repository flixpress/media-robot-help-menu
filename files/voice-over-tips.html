<h1>Voice Over Tips</h1>

<p>If you are creating a video that you&#8217;d like to use with a voiceover, or narration of some kind we&#8217;ve got a few tips for you.</p>

<p>There are two ways to add spoken narration, or voice over, to your video:</p>

<p>The first way to add narration to your video is to pre-record your voice over and upload it to your account as an .mp3 file and then add it to your project.</p>

<p>If you pre-record your voiceover, you&#8217;ll probably want to use the audio pane to help you align the transitions to your recording. Check out our help video called &#8220;Using the audio pane&#8221; for more information on how to do that.</p>

<p>The second way to add narration to your video is to create your video in Flixpress and add your voiceover in other video editing software such as Adobe Premiere, Final Cut, or even through YouTube&#8217;s editor at <a href="https://youtube.com/editor" target="_blank">YouTube.com/editor</a>.</p>
