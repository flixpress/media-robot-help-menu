<h1>Custom Image Quality</h1>

<p>Flixpress allows you to use your own custom images in many of our layouts. Here&#8217;s a few tips for getting the best quality our of your finished video if you use your own images.</p>

<p>All of our Pro Templates use a 16:9 aspect ratio for images. We&#8217;ll always give you the opportunity to crop your images to fit that size, but it is good to remember that your images are going to be wider than they are tall when you are choosing them.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll also want to make sure that they are high quality images. Uploading images that are small could make for blurry results in your finished video. We highly recommend that your images are at least 1280 pixels wide by 720 pixels tall AFTER they are cropped. Images from most modern cameras and smartphones are actually large enough in their un-edited state. Just be sure to shoot in landscape orientation, not portrait, when capturing your image.</p>

<p>If you are just absolutely stuck with an image that is not large enough, don&#8217;t enlarge it yourself (unless you are a photoshop fractal enlargement wiz). Go ahead and upload it as is to flixpress. We&#8217;ll enlarge it the best we can, but don&#8217;t be surprised to see some blurry results.</p>
