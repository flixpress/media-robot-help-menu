<h1>Long Form Text</h1>

<p>Sometimes it might be tempting to add long-form text to your flixpress pro template slides. We even have layouts dedicated to long form text as you can see, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you should use them too often.</p>

<p>Often times, a viewer&#8217;s first response to seeing long form text in a video is not to immediately start reading the text. Rather it is to wonder &#8220;Am I going to have time to read this?&#8221;</p>

<p>It is usually best to stay away from long text passages. Here are some general tips to consider before you add lots of text to your video:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t treat your video like a powerpoint presentation. It is an immersive video presentation, so take advantage of that! consider doing a voice over for long text. Consider <em>showing</em> instead of <em>telling</em> with video clips and images.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t forget that people read at different speeds. Keeping all your text short will ensure that everyone gets your message on the first viewing&#8230; not many people will give you a second chance!</li>
<li>Try using your video to direct people to your long-form content instead of including it right there in your video.</li>
<li>Put more in-depth information on the same page as your video, as we have done here. The video above gives the general idea, but the content around it&#8212;that people can read at their own pace&#8212;gives the full story.</li>
<li>If it still makes sense to use long-form text in your video, be sure to increase the duration of the slide to ensure that even the slowest readers among your target audience will be able to catch everything before the video moves them along.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t start your video with long form text. Build your viewer&#8217;s trust by showing them that you are keeping your content on screen long enough for them to take it in. You can do this with short phrases and images first. Then, after the viewer is confident that you are giving them the proper amount of time to take in your content, add the long form text.</li>
</ul>
