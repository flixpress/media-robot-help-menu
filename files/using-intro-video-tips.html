<h1>Using a Flixpress intro with your own video</h1>

<p>Flixpress gives you the ability to create some pretty cool intros for your video series or YouTube channel. But how do you get them into your videos?</p>

<p>First, remember that Flixpress is not video editing software. Some of our pro templates are fully realized pieces, but many of our templates are designed for you to use inside your larger projects, which is obviously the case if you are making an intro to your video.</p>

<p>If you happen to be using YouTube to deliver your videos to your audience, you can merge the videos together using YouTube&#8217;s very own editor at <a href="https://youtube.com/editor" target="_blank">YouTube.com/editor</a>. You&#8217;ll want to upload your Flixpress-created video as it&#8217;s own file. Then you can use their editor to put the two together. For more information about using YouTube&#8217;s editor, check out their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/YouTubeHelp/search?query=video+editor" target="_blank">help page</a>.</p>

<p>And of course, if you are making your own videos, you can download your intro from Flixpress and add it in using your favorite editor.</p>
